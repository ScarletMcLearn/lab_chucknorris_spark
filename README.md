# Build a Chat Bot with Chuck Norris, Python and Docker

Code and resources for coding tutorial **Build a Chat Bot with Chuck Norris, Python and Docker:** *Have a little fun while we learn about Spark Bot creation*. 

### Abstract
Can a Chuck Norris Bot deliver a roundhouse kick? Find out in this session where we build a Chuck Norris joke telling Chat Bot! We'll write our bot using Python and package it up as a Docker image to make it portable. Along the way you'll learn about Webhooks and their importance in cloud applications, Micro-Services and the Cisco Spark Collaboration Cloud, all skills you can then use to build your own Bots to accomplish any task you can think of! This session is designed to be fun and hands on, so make sure to bring your laptop, sense of humor and great questions!
